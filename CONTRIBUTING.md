## Repository Setup Guide

This guide offers detailed instructions for setting up a repository, installing dependencies, configuring a server, and starting the server for a Java application.

### Clone the Repository

1. **Install Git:** If Git is not already installed, download and install it from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
   
2. **Clone Repository:** Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository. Run the following command, replacing `<repository_url>` with the URL of your Git repository (e.g., from GitHub, GitLab):
   
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Kasun-Abeywickrama/DEA-Project.git
    ```

### Install Dependencies

1. **Navigate to Project Directory:** After cloning the repository, navigate to the cloned project directory:
   
    ```bash
    cd DEA-Project
    ```

2. **Install Java Libraries:** Install the required Java libraries using a dependency management tool like Maven or Gradle. Instructions may vary depending on your project setup.

### Configure Server

1. **Set up GlassFish Server:** Set up GlassFish Server on the new computer by following the official documentation available [here](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E26576_01/index.htm).
   
2. **Deploy Application:** Deploy your application to GlassFish. Refer to the GlassFish documentation or your project's specific deployment instructions for details.

### Start the Server

1. **Start GlassFish Server:** Start GlassFish Server on the new computer.

### Additional Considerations

1. **Database Setup:** If your application interacts with a database, configure the database connection details on the new computer.
   
2. **Environment Variables:** If your application relies on environment variables, ensure they're set appropriately on the new machine.
   
3. **Project-Specific Configuration:** Adjust the provided instructions based on any project-specific setup or deployment requirements.

**Note:** Use the provided code snippets with caution and ensure compatibility with your system environment and project requirements.

## Making Changes

* **Write Clear Code:** Strive to write clean, well-commented code that is easy to understand and maintain.
* **Unit Tests:** If applicable, consider adding unit tests for your changes to ensure functionality.
* **Commit Messages:** Use descriptive commit messages that explain the purpose of your changes.

## Submitting Changes

1. **Push your branch:** Once your changes are complete and tested, push your branch to your repository.
2. **Create a Pull Request:** On GitHub, navigate to the repository and create a pull request from your branch to the main branch of the  repository.
3. **Review Process:** We will review your pull request and provide feedback. Be prepared to address any comments or suggestions before your changes are merged.
