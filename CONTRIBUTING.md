## Repository Setup Guide

This guide offers detailed instructions for setting up a repository, installing dependencies, configuring a server, and starting the server for a Java application.

### Clone the Repository

To clone a repository using GitHub Desktop, follow these steps:

1. **Download and Install GitHub Desktop:**
   - Visit the GitHub Desktop website: [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
   - Download the appropriate version for your operating system (Windows or macOS).
   - Install GitHub Desktop by following the installation instructions provided.

2. **Open GitHub Desktop:**
   - Once installed, open GitHub Desktop from your applications or programs menu.

3. **Sign in to GitHub:**
   - If you haven't already signed in, you'll need to sign in using your GitHub credentials. If you don't have a GitHub account, you can create one for free.

4. **Clone the Repository:**
   - In GitHub Desktop, click on the "File" menu in the top-left corner.
   - Select "Clone Repository" from the dropdown menu.
   - You will be prompted to enter the URL of the repository you want to clone. Enter: `https://github.com/Kasun-Abeywickrama/DEA-Project.git`
   - Choose the local path where you want to clone the repository on your computer.
   - Click "Clone" to initiate the cloning process.

5. **Open the Cloned Repository:**
   - Once the cloning process is complete, you'll see the repository listed in GitHub Desktop.
   - Click on the repository to open it and view its contents.

  
6. **Create your Branch:** 

   1. **Switch to Development Branch**.
   2. **Create New Branch**: `Branch` -> `New Branch` -> Name it `feature/<suitable_name_for_your_work>` -> `Create Branch`.
   

7. **Switch to your branch.**

   1. **View Branches:**
      - Once you've selected the repository, you'll see a toolbar at the top of the GitHub Desktop window. Click on the "Current Branch" dropdown menu. It will display the currently checked out branch.

   2. **Choose Your Branch:**
      - From the dropdown menu, select the branch you want to switch to. If your branch isn't listed, you might need to fetch it first by clicking the "Fetch origin" button.

   3. **Switch Branch:**
      - After selecting the desired branch from the dropdown menu, GitHub Desktop will automatically switch to that branch locally.

8. **Create WEB-INF Folder**
   * Navigate to this path Project_folder\E-Commerce-Website\web.
   * If there is no WEB-INF folder here, Create an empty folder named WEB-INF.

9. Open this project folder in Netbeans IDE.
